plotbrowser
===========

A GUI to change the appearance of matplotlib plots, useful for quick tweaks of plots and for those unfamiliar with matplotlib syntax. Uses the object-oriented interface of matplotlib when possible.

Written in Python 2.7 and PySide 1.2. Python 3 and PyQt4 should also work but not fully tested.

To do: option to make changes the default by editing rcParams or the matplotlibrc file.
