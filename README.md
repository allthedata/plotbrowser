plotbrowser
===========

A GUI to change the appearance of matplotlib plots, useful for quick tweaks of plots and for finding the matplotlib syntax to do something (just read the method connected to the widget!). Uses the object-oriented interface of matplotlib when possible.

Written in Python 2.7 and PySide 1.2, with the help of Qt Designer. Python 3 and PyQt4 should also work but not fully tested. IPython with the qtconsole is required so that you still have access to the shell when the GUI comes up.

To do: option to make changes the default by editing rcParams or the matplotlibrc file.

Requires:
- ipython
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyside or pyqt4

Usage
-----------

Run in a terminal:
```sh
ipython --pylab=qt
run /path/to/plotbrowser.py
```
Using the GUI, create a figure, then a subplot or axes, then a line. Or use the python shell and click "refresh list" to update the list of figures. Double-click an item in the lists of figures, axes, and lines to change the window title, axes title, and line label respectively.

By changing a few things, we can get ggplot style plots...
